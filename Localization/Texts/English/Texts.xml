	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Armor_Name" Value="Cuirass of the Sand Warden" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Armor_DescriptionShort" Value="These armor plates belonged to elite warriors who guarded the borders of an ancient empire under the scorching sun and desert winds. Their design combines the strength of iron with the flexibility of leather." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Armor_DescriptionFull" Value="The Cuirass of the Sand Warden was crafted for veteran soldiers serving in special frontier units of the Old Kingdom. Its iron plates are masterfully forged in shapes resembling chest muscles, symbolizing courage and strength. Additional leather elements below provided comfort and freedom of movement, essential in harsh desert conditions. It is believed that each cuirass was blessed by a priest before being sent into battle, granting the wearer protection and spiritual strength. The engraved patterns on the chestplate depict stylized sandstorms - a mark of endurance and resilience. Today, this armor stands as a rare relic honoring the military valor of ancient warriors." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Helmet_Name" Value="Helm of the Dune Sentinel" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Helmet_DescriptionShort" Value="A bronze-forged helmet worn by the desert watchmen of a forgotten empire, offering both protection and intimidation on the battlefield." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Helmet_DescriptionFull" Value="The Helm of the Dune Sentinel was crafted for elite guards stationed in the arid frontiers of the ancient realm. Forged from sun-tempered bronze, the helmet features a tall, crested design meant to make its wearer appear taller and more fearsome. Its polished surface once gleamed under the desert sun, reflecting light to disorient enemies during battle. The narrow eye slits provided focus and defense, while intricate engravings along the edges symbolized loyalty and vigilance. Legends say that the helm bore a blessing that sharpened the wearer’s senses and granted visions of approaching threats in the heat-haze. Today, it remains a revered artifact of a warrior caste lost to time." />

	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Bust_DescriptionShort" Value="A marble bust immortalizing a young ruler, believed to embody divine wisdom and military triumph." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_1_Quest_Bust_DescriptionFull" Value="The Bust of the Glorious Heir was sculpted during the late classical period, likely as part of a temple shrine devoted to a semi-divine sovereign. His features - flowing hair, serene gaze, and confident lips - reflect the idealized vision of rulership in ancient myth. Such images were often associated with hero-conquerors who unified scattered city-states in times of great peril. Carved from a single slab of sacred marble, said to be mined in ritual sanctuaries, the bust was believed to channel the protective spirit of the figure it represented. More than decoration, it served as a spiritual anchor in royal halls and sacred sites, guarding legacy and lineage across generations." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Armor_Name" Value="Aegis of the Voidwalker" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Armor_DescriptionShort" Value="A next-generation exo-armor designed for survival and combat in hostile star systems beyond the reach of civilization." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Armor_DescriptionFull" Value="The Aegis of the Voidwalker is a modular combat exosuit developed by the Interstellar Vanguard for operations in black-zone sectors of the galaxy. Its plating is composed of hyper-compressed cerametal and adaptive kinetic mesh, offering superior protection against energy weapons, micrometeorite impacts, and biological threats. The armor integrates a full-body environmental regulation system, allowing the wearer to survive in vacuum, toxic atmospheres, or plasma storms. Internally, a neurolink interface syncs with the user's reflexes, enhancing speed, strength, and situational awareness. Though built for the elite, many such armors now lie adrift in dead zones - silent witnesses to battles no one remembers." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Helmet_Name" Value="Helm of the Starbound Vanguard" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Helmet_DescriptionShort" Value="An advanced space helmet designed for deep-galactic exploration, offering both survival and command-grade interface systems." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Helmet_DescriptionFull" Value="The Helm of the Starbound Vanguard represents the pinnacle of 7th-era aerospace engineering, crafted for elite pilots and officers venturing beyond known space. Its exterior is forged from reactive nano-alloy plating, capable of adapting to radiation surges, vacuum pressure, and atmospheric anomalies. Internally, the helmet features a multi-layered HUD with neural-sync capabilities, allowing instant tactical readouts, language translation, and AI-assisted decision-making. The visor uses photonic smart-glass that darkens against stellar flares and enhances low-light visibility. Legends speak of commanders who wore this helm to lead expeditions through black hole systems and never returned - their helmets still broadcasting signals in the void." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Sword_Name" Value="Solblade V-9" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Sword_DescriptionShort" Value="A high-frequency energy blade forged for elite close-quarters combat in zero-gravity and high-threat environments." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Sword_DescriptionFull" Value="The Solblade V-9 is a prototype energy sword developed by the Helios Initiative, combining solid-state alloy with a photon-charged plasma edge. When activated, the blade emits a distinct solar hum and leaves behind faint trails of ionized air - a mark of its immense thermal output. It can cut through reinforced alloys, deflect energy rounds, and even overload unshielded systems on contact. Embedded micro-reactors keep the blade powered for up to 72 hours of continuous use, while the hilt syncs with the user’s combat neural net for precision control. Carried only by high-clearance operatives, the V-9 is both a weapon and a symbol of status in the fractured future of galactic war." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Gun_Name" Value="XR-77 Pulse Repeater" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Gun_DescriptionShort" Value="A rapid-fire energy rifle engineered for versatility and dominance in both planetary and zero-gravity combat zones." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Gun_DescriptionFull" Value="The XR-77 Pulse Repeater is a military-grade directed-energy weapon developed by NovaForge Systems, optimized for close- to mid-range engagements. It fires concentrated plasma bursts through a magnetic acceleration chamber, delivering sustained damage while maintaining pinpoint accuracy. The weapon features an adaptive recoil stabilization system, allowing users to fire in rapid succession even under zero-G or volatile environmental conditions. Its smart-scope integrates with most tactical visors, offering real-time threat tracking, ammo diagnostics, and heat management. Equipped with a modular rail system, the XR-77 can be customized with silencers, overload amplifiers, or even anti-armor disruptors. It’s the standard-issue firearm of many interstellar special forces - and the nightmare of anyone on the wrong side of the barrel." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Spaceship_Name" Value="Eclipse-Class Starcruiser 'Nightingale'" />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Spaceship_DescriptionShort" Value="A long-range deep-space vessel designed for covert operations, exploration, and tactical precision strikes across the galaxy's darkest sectors." />
	<Text Key="ID_QuestItem_Item_2_Quest_Spaceship_DescriptionFull" Value="The Nightingale is a state-of-the-art Eclipse-Class Starcruiser, built by the Astral Syndicate for high-risk missions beyond charted space. Outfitted with a phase-shift cloaking system and silent ion drives, it can traverse hostile zones undetected, even through pirate-infested nebulae or collapsed wormholes. Its reinforced hull uses reactive shielding and nano-regenerative plating, allowing it to endure prolonged engagements against capital-class threats. Internally, it supports a crew of up to 60, with autonomous AI navigation, drone bays, and surgical-strike drop pods. The Nightingale has been spotted near derelict relic worlds and rumored to have returned from subdimensional anomalies with its logs encrypted. No one knows its full mission history - and those who served aboard seldom speak of it." />
